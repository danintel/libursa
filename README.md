# Ursa Speed
Ursa Speed is a microbenchmark for the Hyperledger Ursa libursa library.

## Introduction
This microbenchmark is intended to run microbenchmarks for popular crypto algorithms in libursa.
For easy comparison, the tests and output are similar to the "openssl speed" microbenchmark.
A microbenchmark is intended only to measure crypto performance, so has no network or disk I/O overhead.

Initially only SHA-2 algorithms are being benchmarked (SHA-256 and SHA-512).
SHA-384 is omitted because it's basically the same as SHA-512 in terms of performance.

In the future, I may add tests for signing and signature verification.

## Prerequisites
This benchmark assumes the ursa repository is installed and built in the parent library, `../ursa`. To download and build, type:
```
git clone https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa
# Since Ursa API has changed, the code works with commit d7ac9e92d4f76cd2b68c974031e4e894200dc4bf
git checkout d7ac9e92d4f76cd2b68c974031e4e894200dc4bf
cd ursa/libursa
cargo build --release
```
This builds libursa.so in "secure" mode (with C/Rust optimizations).
For more information on Ursa, see
https://github.com/hyperledger/ursa/blob/master/README.md
and
https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/ursa

Ursa, in turn, currently requires libsodium.  To install, type
```
apt install libsodium-dev
```


## Building

To build and run, type
```
cargo build --release
```

## Running

To run the libursa and openssl microbenchmarks, type:
```
target/debug/crypto-speed
openssl speed sha256 sha512
cpuid | egrep -i 'brand =|avx:|avx2:|avx512f:' | sort -u
```

To display usage, type:
```
$ target/debug/crypto-speed -h
